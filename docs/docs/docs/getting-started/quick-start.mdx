## Installation

The React Native Brownfield library is intended to be installed in a **React Native app** that is later consumed as a **framework artifact** by your native iOS or Android app.

In your React Native project run:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @callstack/react-native-brownfield" />

### iOS Setup

Run **`pod install`** in your iOS directory.

### Android Setup

The library will be **automatically linked** via autolinking.

## What is the Brownfield CLI?

The `@callstack/react-native-brownfield` package includes a **built-in CLI** that handles the complex process of packaging your React Native app into native framework artifacts.

### Why do you need it?

Integrating React Native into an existing native app requires packaging your JavaScript code and native dependencies into formats that native apps can consume:

- **iOS** → **XCFramework** (`.xcframework`)
- **Android** → **AAR** (`.aar`)

Without the CLI, this process involves:

- Manually configuring build scripts
- Bundling JavaScript with the correct settings
- Compiling native code for multiple architectures
- Handling Hermes bytecode compilation
- Managing native dependencies and linking

The **Brownfield CLI automates all of this** with simple commands.

### What does it do?

| Command                 | Platform | Output                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`package:ios`**       | iOS      | Creates an XCFramework containing your React Native app, Hermes runtime, and all native dependencies |
| **`package:aar`**       | Android  | Creates a Fat-AAR containing your React Native app bundled with all native dependencies              |
| **`publish-local:aar`** | Android  | Publishes the AAR to your local Maven repository for easy consumption                                |

### How does it make integration easier?

1. **No Node.js in your native app** - Your native iOS/Android app doesn't need Node.js, npm, or any JavaScript tooling installed
2. **Single artifact** - All React Native code and dependencies are bundled into one file
3. **Debug & Release support** - The CLI handles both configurations automatically
4. **Architecture support** - Builds for all required CPU architectures (arm64, x86_64, etc.)

## Next Steps

Now that you have the library installed, follow the platform-specific guides to package your React Native app and integrate it with your native app:

- [**iOS Integration**](/docs/getting-started/ios) - Package as XCFramework and integrate with your iOS app
- [**Android Integration**](/docs/getting-started/android) - Package as AAR and integrate with your Android app
