- `AndroidApp` - an Android app consuming the packaged artifact from `RNApp` or `ExpoApp`, in which you can refer to an exemplar usage of the library for integrating React Native Brownfield into a native Android app; this app comes in two flavors:
  - `expo` - which uses the artifact produced from `ExpoApp`
  - `vanilla` - which uses the artifact produced from `RNApp`
- `AppleApp` - an iOS app consuming the packaged artifact from `RNApp`, in which you can refer to an exemplar usage of the library for integrating React Native Brownfield into a native iOS app; this app comes in two configurations:
