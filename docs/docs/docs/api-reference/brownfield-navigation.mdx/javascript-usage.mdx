# JavaScript Usage

Use the generated JavaScript API after native delegate registration is complete.

## Import and call methods

```ts
import BrownfieldNavigation from '@callstack/brownfield-navigation';

BrownfieldNavigation.navigateToSettings();
BrownfieldNavigation.navigateToReferrals('user-123');
```

## Example screen usage

```tsx
import { Button, View } from 'react-native';
import BrownfieldNavigation from '@callstack/brownfield-navigation';

export function NativeLinks() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Button
        title="Open native settings"
        onPress={() => BrownfieldNavigation.navigateToSettings()}
      />
      <Button
        title="Open native referrals"
        onPress={() => BrownfieldNavigation.navigateToReferrals('user-123')}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Best practices

- Keep JS method names aligned with actual native destinations.
- Pass stable, explicit params (`userId`, IDs, flags) rather than derived UI state.
- Add runtime guards in app startup so delegate registration always happens first.

## When to run codegen again

Rerun codegen if any of these change:

- Method names
- Method parameters
- Method return types

```bash
yarn brownfield:navigation-codegen
```

## Common errors

- **`undefined is not a function` on method call**:
  method was changed in spec, but app was not regenerated/rebuilt.
- **Native crash on method call**:
  delegate was not registered before JS usage.
- **Method exists but does nothing**:
  native delegate method was generated but not implemented in host app.
