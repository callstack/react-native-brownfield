# Unified brownfield CLI

The React Native Brownfield ecosystem comes with a batteries-included, all-in-one CLI tool called `brownfield` that helps you build and publish your React Native app as a framework artifact for iOS (XCFramework) and Android (AAR).
Additionally, it contains CLI utilities for other tools like the `@callstack/brownie` state management tool.

> [!NOTE]
> The `brownfield` CLI is a unified tool serving both the needs of `@callstack/react-native-brownfield` and `@callstack/brownie` packages. The name `brownfield` does not mean it is only meant for `@callstack/brownie` state management tool; it is the main CLI for React Native Brownfield as well.
> Technically, the CLI itself is encapsulated in the `@callstack/brownie-cli` package, which is a dependency of both `@callstack/react-native-brownfield` and `@callstack/brownie`. Therefore, installing either of the packages will bring the `brownfield` CLI tool to your project.

## Usage

Please refer to the appropriate pages for detailed usage instructions:
