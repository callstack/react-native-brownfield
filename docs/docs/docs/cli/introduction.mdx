# Unified brownfield CLI

The React Native Brownfield ecosystem comes with a batteries-included, all-in-one CLI tool exposing the binary `brownfield`.
The CLI automates the process of packaging a React Native / Expo app as a framework artifact for iOS (XCFramework) and Android (AAR).
The `brownfield` CLI is the home for the whole brownfield ecosystem, hosting both the tools for `@callstack/react-native-brownfield` and for `@callstack/brownie` state management library.

Technically, the CLI itself is encapsulated in the `@callstack/brownfield-cli` package, which is a dependency of both `@callstack/react-native-brownfield` and `@callstack/brownie`. Therefore, installing either of the packages will bring the `brownfield` CLI tool to your project.

## Usage

Please refer to the appropriate pages for detailed usage instructions for each of the ecosystem packages:

- [`@callstack/react-native-brownfield` - Brownfield library commands](./brownfield)
- [`@callstack/brownie` - Brownie state management library commands](./brownie)
