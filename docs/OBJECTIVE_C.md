**Methods:**

`startReactNative`

Starts React Native, produces an instance of a bridge. You can use it to initialize React Native in your app.

Params:

| Param                   | Required | Type          | Description                                           |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| onBundleLoaded          | No       | void(^)(void) | Callback invoked after JS bundle is fully loaded.     |
| launchOptions           | No       | NSDictionary  | Launch options, typically passed from AppDelegate.    |

Examples:

```objc
    [[ReactNativeBrownfield shared] startReactNative];
```

```objc
    [[ReactNativeBrownfield shared] startReactNative:^(void){
        NSLog(@"React Native started");
    }];
```

```objc
    [[ReactNativeBrownfield shared] startReactNative:^(void){
        NSLog(@"React Native started");
    }, launchOptions];
```

---

#### ReactNativeViewController

A view controller that's rendering `RCTRootView` within its bounds. It automatically uses an instance of a bridge created in `startReactNative` method. It works well with exposed JavaScript module. It's the simplest way to embed React Native into your navigation stack.

You can import it from:

```objc
  #import <ReactNativeBrownfield/ReactNativeViewController.h>
```

---

**Constructors:**

`[ReactNativeViewController initWithModuleName:moduleName andInitialProperties:initialProps]`

| Param              | Required  | Type          | Description                                                   |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| moduleName         | Yes       | NSString      | Name of React Native component registered to `AppRegistry`.   |
| initialProperties  | No        | NSString      | Initial properties to be passed to React Native component.    |

Examples:

```objc
  [[ReactNativeViewController alloc] initWithModuleName:@"ReactNative"]
```

```objc
  [[ReactNativeViewController alloc] initWithModuleName:@"ReactNative" andInitialProperties:@{@"score": 12}]
```
