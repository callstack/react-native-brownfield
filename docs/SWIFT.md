## Swift

React Native Brownfield provides first-class support for Swift. 

### `use_frameworks!` support

It is possible to build `react-native-brownfield` with `use_frameworks!` directive in CocoaPods as long as `React` can be built this way.

| React Native version       | `use_frameworks!` compatibility |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | 
| <= 0.59.X                  | Compatible                      |
| 0.60.X                     | Not compatible                  |
| 0.61.0-rc.0                | Not compatible                  |

Please reffer to [this issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/25349) to learn more about `use_frameworks!` state in React Native.

Until this behavior is fixed, you can access `react-native-brownfield` API in Swift via [Bridging Header](../example/swift/BridgingHeader.h).

### Linking

The library is meant to work with [auto linking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md). In case you can't use this feature, please check out the following options:

<details>
<summary>react-native link</summary>
Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
  react-native link @callstack/react-native-brownfield
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>CocoaPods</summary>
Add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
  pod 'ReactNativeBrownfield', :path => '../node_modules/@callstack/react-native-brownfield'
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Manually link the library on iOS</summary>

### `Open project.xcodeproj in Xcode`

Drag `ReactNativeBrownfield.xcodeproj` to your project on Xcode (usually under the Libraries group on Xcode):

### Link `libReactNativeBrownfield.a` binary with libraries

Click on your main project file (the one that represents the `.xcodeproj`) select `Build Phases` and drag the static library from the `Products` folder inside the Library you are importing to `Link Binary With Libraries` (or use the `+` sign and choose library from the list):

---

**Methods:**

`startReactNative`

Starts React Native, produces an instance of a bridge. You can use it to initialize React Native in your app.

Params:

| Param                   | Required | Type          | Description                                           |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| onBundleLoaded          | No       | (() -> Void)? | Callback invoked after JS bundle is fully loaded.     |
| launchOptions           | No       | [AnyHashable: Any]? | Launch options, typically passed from AppDelegate. |

Examples:

```swift
    ReactNativeBrownfield.shared.startReactNative()
```

```swift
   ReactNativeBrownfield.shared.startReactNative(onBundleLoaded: {
     print("React Native started")
   })
```

```swift
    ReactNativeBrownfield.shared.startReactNative(onBundleLoaded: {
      print("React Native started")
    }, launchOptions: launchOptions)
```

---

#### ReactNativeViewController

A view controller that's rendering React Native view within its bounds. It automatically uses an instance of a factory created in `startReactNative` method. It works well with exposed JavaScript module. It's the simplest way to embed React Native into your navigation stack.

You can import it from:

```swift
  import ReactNativeBrownfield
```

---

**Constructors:**

`ReactNativeViewController(moduleName: moduleName, initialProperties: initialProperties)`

| Param              | Required  | Type          | Description                                                   |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| moduleName         | Yes       | String        | Name of React Native component registered to `AppRegistry`.   |
| initialProperties  | No        | [String: Any]? | Initial properties to be passed to React Native component.    |

Examples:

```swift
  ReactNativeViewController(moduleName: "ReactNative")
```

```swift
  ReactNativeViewController(moduleName: "ReactNative", initialProperties: ["score": 12])
```
